# blursed_streaks, v 1.2 
2024 08 15
Blursed Streaks drops a perk at game start that reduces the player's starting health by 1 for every consecutive win in their current streak. It also increases the player's starting health by 1 for every consecutive loss in their current streak.

The Gods are Watching. You have been Cursed. Or Blessed. You have been Blursed.
Use Blursed Streaks as an immersive way to track how long it's been since you've won the game. Or how long it's been since you actually lost, if winning is your style.

Configuration options let you set a value for how consecutive wins or losses affect your total health, and they accept positive and negative modifiers, so you could even flip the script and punish yourself with less health every time you lose.
You can also set a flag that will consider any run a victory as long as you die with the Sampo. I know I like to go die exploring after my hubris kicks in...
